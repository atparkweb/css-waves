# CSS Shimmer Effect

A lo-fi wavy effect using CSS3 transitions

I wanted to play around with CSS 3 transitions, so I decided to apply a wave effect to an image. I was inspired by the 16-bit era RPGs (e.g. Final Fantasy VI) where I remember seeing this effect used.

I used JavaScript/jQuery to set the timing, manipulate classes, and attach event handlers. CSS transitions are applied to the `background-position` property.
